# Cracking The Coding Interview
It describes typical problems in computer science that are often asked during coding interviews, typically on a whiteboard during job interviews at big technology companies.
The codes for problems contained in this repository are properly commented, I have tried my best to make all the codes understandable just by reading, and understanding the root of the problem.

## For better understaing,

Just iterate the codes by using pen and paper line by line if you stuck somewhere. Still if you don't get the approach. Feel free to contact me at -> <a href="http://aboutaakash.in/contact"><button>Contact Me!</button></a>
